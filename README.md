# "Improving Clinical Trial Design via a Statistical Machine Learning-Based Interface" Artifacts and Reports

This repository serves as a version-controlled backup and public showcase of outputs from my ongoing research project using the AACT clinical trials database.

Contents may include:

- Quarto-generated HTML reports (e.g. `criteria_thoughts.html`)
- R scripts for data querying and wrangling (`tidyverse`, `arrow`, `DBI`, etc.)
- Python scripts for additional data processing or analysis
- Supporting files and documentation

The project explores challenges in parsing eligibility criteria from clinical trial records, with the goal of feature engineering for machine learning models.
