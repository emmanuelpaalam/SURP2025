# "Improving Clinical Trial Design via a Statistical Machine Learning-Based Interface" Artifacts and Reports

This repository serves as a version-controlled backup and public showcase of outputs from my ongoing research project using the AACT clinical trials database.

Contents may include:

- Quarto-generated HTML reports
- R scripts for data querying and wrangling
- Supporting files and documentation

The project explores challenges in parsing eligibility criteria from clinical trial records, with the goal of feature engineering for machine learning models.
